# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 2019-05-01

* Added the Settings menu with one setting so far, to turn the sound off/on. 

I created the Android Studio "Settings Activity" to ensure that I'm not using any deprecated code from the online tutorials, and then deleted all the unnecessary stuff from it (but it's good to know that there is sample code for all kinds of settings), and customized the rest, using mostly [this guide](https://medium.com/@bhavyankaria/step-by-step-guide-to-create-app-settings-using-preferences-in-android-part-1-fa470305b530) as a reference. 

* Added the date title separator between the reports on the main page. (By adding a TextView for the date to the report list item, and hiding it in the adapter for all the items except those where the date changes.)
