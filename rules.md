# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
May 1, 2019.

## Additional Rules
1. I will count only the code written for my own projects, not for my employer.
2. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge, unless I'll get stuck with my main project and will require a crash course on some skill I lack.
3. I will update the  [Log](log.md) with the day's progress, and tweet about my progress using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode .
