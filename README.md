# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge

Currently I'm working on my personal gamification app (for Android, in Java), which is not unlike [Habitica](https://habitica.com/), but it has different game mechanics, and uses the metaphor of a (magical) school, where you assign yourself points for classes. I'll be updating the [Log](log.md) with my progress, but the actual code stays private for the time being. Maybe later, when/if I get to rewriting it in Kotlin.

I might switch to other projects after completing this one (the app is already functional, but I keep coming up with ideas ;) Or if I'll be stuck with a low-end computer without Android Studio, or for something more urgent, etc... it's a free world :) 

If you've decided to join, see [the official repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/) with all the links, official rules and stuff.
