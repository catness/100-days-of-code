# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge

Currently I'm working on my personal gamification app (for Android, in Java), which is not unlike [Habitica](https://habitica.com/), but it has different game mechanics, and uses the metaphor of a (magical) school, where you assign yourself points for classes. I'll be updating the [Log](log.md) with my progress, but the actual code stays private for the time being. Maybe later, when/if I get to rewriting it in Kotlin.

Update: it is done! I'll keep using the app, fixing the bugs as they come up, and I'll think about publishing it if I find it useful enough.

Now starting another project - a shape-matching game with Unicode fonts (not match-3). I already have the prototype done in LibGDX, but I want to rewrite it in pure Android code, or at least to compare and see which version turns out better.

Update: the game is done for now! I'll keep testing it; meanwhile, back to the Classroom app, to implement a couple of new ideas.

If you've decided to join, see [the official repo](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code) with all the links, official rules and stuff.
